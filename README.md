# Raincheque

Raincheque is a small example app that determines your current location, shows it on a map, checks the weather where you're at, and suggests if now is the right time to save your money.

This app demonstrates an approach to building a client-side web application that interacts with several APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

## APIs
- HTML5 Geolocation
- Yahoo! Weather API
- Google Maps API

## Setup

You'll need to get an API key for Google Maps for this app to work properly.

You can run the app locally by navigating to your project directory on the command line and running the following command:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`

This requires you to have Python installed on your system. This will most likely work out of the box on Mac, Windows users will need to install Python.

Once it's running, you can visit the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
